The key point for this question is that you should recognize the states switching process. 
Essentially, it's a thinking about state pattern.

Four States for a vending machine:
-----------------------------------
1. Empty (Nothing in vending machine) 
2. Coin Inserted
3. No Coin Inserted
4. Dispense a merchandise 


You can use integer to represent state like this:
      private final static int HAS_MONEY = 0;  
      private final static int NO_MONEY = 1;  
      private final static int SOLD = 2;  
      private final static int SOLD_OUT = 3;

BUT it'd be better to use classes with designed inheritance relationship, like following
      State coninInsertedState = new CoinInsertedState(this);
      State emptyState = new EmptyState(this);
      State noCoinInsertedState = new NoCoinInsertedState(this);
      State dispensingState = new DispensingState(this);
