Some Rules:
-----------------
Player chooses piece to move through the board.
Piece makes legal move according to its own move rules.
.
If player captures a piece, remove the piece.
If the piece is a pawn reaching the back rank, promote it.
If the move is a castling, set the new position of the rook accordingly. But a king and rook can only castle if they haven't moved, so you need to keep track of that. And if the king moves through a check to castle, that's disallowed, too.
If the move results in a stalemate or checkmate, the game is over.
